### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 1 with Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting and Preceding Question Prompting  

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
### 1. Define the Scenario and Use Case  
- **Scenario:**  
   In today’s fast-paced lifestyle, people are increasingly health-conscious and want to know the **nutritional information** of the food they consume. Restaurants, cafeterias, and online food services require an automated system to present food menu details clearly and attractively.  

- **Use Case:**  
   The system will generate a **nutritional chart** for food menus that includes calories, protein, fat, and allergens. This structured representation helps customers make informed choices.  

- **Target Audience:**  
   - Restaurants and Cafeterias  
   - Online Food Delivery Platforms  
   - Health-conscious customers

### 3. Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect  

#### 💡 Idea Generation Prompts
- **Prompt:** “What features should be included in a food menu nutritional chart in tabular format?”  
- **Generated Ideas:**  
  - Dish name with short description and main ingredients.  
  - Nutritional values: **Calories, Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, Fiber**.  
  - Special highlights for **allergen information** (like gluten, dairy, nuts, soy).  
  - A standardized **table structure** for quick comparison.  
  - Symbols or color highlights for health categories (✔ High Protein, 🟢 Low Fat).  
  - Add a column for **“Dietary Suitability”** (e.g., Vegan, Vegetarian, Keto-friendly).  

---

#### 👩‍💻 Persona and Context Prompts
- **Prompt:** “What should the nutritional chart convey to the end-user?”  
- **Generated Context:**  
  - Customers must feel the chart is **reliable and accurate**.  
  - It should support **dietary decision-making** (weight loss, bodybuilding, etc.).  
  - The design should be **simple** so even non-technical users understand it.  
  - Provide **trust and transparency** from the restaurant or provider.  
  - Support **quick scanning** of dishes (people don’t read long paragraphs).  
  - Encourage healthier choices by showing comparisons side by side.  

---

#### 🎨 Structural / Formatting Prompts
- **Prompt:** “How should the nutritional data be displayed for maximum clarity?”  
- **Generated Structures:**  
  - A **clean, tabular format** with consistent alignment.  
  - Use **headers** for each nutritional category.  
  - Keep **units standardized** (kcal, grams).  
  - Separate **allergens** in a distinct column or highlight them.  
  - Optionally include **icons** for vegetarian 🌱, vegan 🥗, or non-veg 🍗 dishes.  

---

#### 📊 Analytical / Expansion Prompts
- **Prompt:** “How can the chart provide more than just numbers?”  
- **Generated Enhancements:**  
  - Include **daily value percentages** (e.g., 15% of daily protein needs).  
  - Add **health labels** like “Low Carb,” “Heart Healthy,” or “High Fiber.”  
  - Group dishes by **category** (Starters, Mains, Desserts).  
  - Show **comparisons** (this dish vs. average daily needs).  
  - Provide **diet recommendations** (e.g., good for post-workout meals).  

---

#### 🧩 Example Combined Prompt Workflow
1. **Idea Prompt:** Generate list of essential columns for nutritional chart.  
2. **Persona Prompt:** Adjust columns for user needs (diet-conscious, allergen-sensitive).  
3. **Structural Prompt:** Format in table with aligned headers.  
4. **Analytical Prompt:** Enrich table with health labels and dietary suitability.
